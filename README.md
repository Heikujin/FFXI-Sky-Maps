# FFXI-Sky-Maps
It's always bothered me how low quality the maps for Sky are in FFXI.  With the popularity of AI upscalers, I thought I would give upscaling them a try.  Maps are upscaled to 2048x2048 resolution using CupScale.  Some maps upscale really well but some(Ru'Aun Gardens for example) look a little wonky.  This is due to how low quality the original maps are so the upscaler can't quite make out certain parts so it does it's best.  I could probably redraw those parts before running it through the upscaler to get a better result but even with the wonky parts I think it's still a massive improvement.  I might revisit this later and try to improve them a bit.

## Installation
### Preferred Method:
Move `skyhdmaps` folder into your [XIPivot](https://github.com/Shirk/XIPivot) `DATs` folder and then load it above other map dats you might have in game.  If using Ashita, you can automatically load these buying adding `/pivot add skyhdmaps` to your `default.txt` file located in the `Scripts` folder.

### Manual Method:
Copy 'ROM' folder to your `FINAL FANTASY XI` directory and choose "Yes" when prompted to overwrite.
